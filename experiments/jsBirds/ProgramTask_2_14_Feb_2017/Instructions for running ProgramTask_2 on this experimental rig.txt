Instructions for running ProgramTask4 on this experimental rig

!!! IMPORTANT , to run the most recent version of the task look at the instructions at the bottom of this page

1. Go to Start button, then Control Panel, then Hardware and Sound, then Display, then Change Display settings
then ensure that 
Display is 2. VE248
Resolution is 1920 x 1080
Orientation is Landscape
Multiple displays is 'Extend these displays'
AND it is set to 'This is currently your main display'
(also check that the other display is 1.Dell P2314H and its resolution is 1920 x 1080 (recommended))
If this is not the configuration, then change it so that it becomes the configuration

(If the other monitor is KVM Monitor, this is a mistake to do with the KVM switch - the silver button we use to switch between the monitors.
If this happens, try restarting the behavioral computer so that the correct two monitors come up.
If it can't be fixed, it may still be possible to run the task with KVM Monitor and VE248, just check whether the text on the 
instruction screens fits within the window or if it is cropped. If it is slightly cropped, but still possible to 
work out what the instructions say, then go ahead with the task).

subject_id = 1; 
enter do_practice = true;
recording_flag = true;
dev_string = 'Dev1';
ProgramTask(subject_id, do_practice, recording_flag, dev_string);



1. Double click on Matlab icon (R2010a) or search for Matlab R2010a in the Start menu if not available on the desktop

3. at the matlab command line enter cd C:\Users\User\Documents\MATLAB\ProgramTask4 and hit return

4. check this worked by entering pwd and then return, it should display the file path above

5. enter subject_id = 68 (for example); then hit return, then enter do_practice = true; then return, 
then enter recording_flag = true; then return, then enter dev_string = 'Dev1'; and then return

6. enter ProgramTask(subject_id, do_practice, recording_flag, dev_string); and then return

7. After you have finished, remember to end the deep mind task recording and restart the chronic recording


INSTRUCTIONS AS OF 14 FEB 2017

1. Do step 1 at the top of the page 
2. Do step 1 at the middle of the page (i.e. "Double click on Matlab.."), plus ensure that ProgramTask_2_14_Feb_2017 folder
and all subfolders are on the matlab path (see Set path) and ensure that ProgramTask4 and subfolders and ProgramTask3 and subfolders are not
3. at the matlab command line enter cd C:\Users\User\Documents\MATLAB\ProgramTask_2_14_Feb_2017 and hit return
4. Do step 4 above
5. enter subject_id = 68 (for example), then hit return, then enter task_mode = 'practice' (or 'refresher' or 'full_task' or 'simple_task' or
whichever is appropriate), also enter dev_string = 'Dev1', and return and recording_flag = true and return
6. enter ProgramTask(subject_id, task_mode, recording_flag, dev_string) and then return
7. Do step 7
